I have create design like prototype no other networking or other functionality implemented yet.

# What are the package used : 

1) Google Maps : 
    For google maps, I used https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter package for loading maps.

2) Rating Bar : 
    Currently there is no widget available for rating you have to create your own or used package and i selected second option.
    So for implementing rating i used https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rating_bar package.
    
    If you want to get more idea about above packages you should go through this link where you can find the description as well as installation steps.
